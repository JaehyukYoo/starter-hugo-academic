I completed my Master's Degree in Educational Technology from Seoul National University (SNU), advised by Dr. Cheolil Lim. I currently work as a graduate research assistant at the Center for Innovation of Future Education in SNU. {style="text-align: justify;"}

My research interest lies at the intersection of classroom technology integration, instructional design, curriculum development, social learning communities, and teacher technology training. {style="text-align: justify;"}

My current research focuses on the design and effectiveness of conversational AI technologies to serve as learning companions, and how AI affects learners' social interactions and learning processes. In addition, I explore learners' understanding of AI and develop programs to foster their AI literacy.
