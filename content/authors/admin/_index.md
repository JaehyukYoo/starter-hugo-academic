I completed my Master's Degree in Educational Technologies from Seoul National University (SNU), advised by Dr. Cheolil Lim. I currently work as a graduate research assistant at the Center for Innovation of Future Education in SNU. 

My current research focuses on the design and effectiveness of conversational AI technologies to serve as learning companions, and how AI affects learners' social interactions and learning processes. In addition, I explore learners' understanding of AI and develop programs to foster their AI literacy.
